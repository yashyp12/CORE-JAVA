# LinkedList

- accept null values 
- follow insertion order
- linked list faster than arraylist due to shifting
- 
- part of collection framework implements list inetrface
- store elemetns in double linekd list
- implementation class of list interface
- stores data at non contingous memory
- best insertion adn removal operations O(1)

- linked list is a linear data structure where each elemetn is a seperate object called node , 
each node contains two parts
- 1 - Data - value stored in ndoe
- 2 -Pointers - two pointers , one pointing to then next and other pointing previous node (previous)


# Performance Consideration 
1 - Insertion deletions - better due to does not requires shifting

2 - Random Access - linked list has slower random access comapre to arraylist 

3 - Memory overhead - requires more memory than arraylit because each node stores references of previous and next node
