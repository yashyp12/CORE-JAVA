Stack - 

Stack extends vector , it is synchronized, making it thread safe

LIFO Structure: Stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

Inheritance: Stack is a subclass of Vector, which means it inherits all the features of a dynamic array but is constrained by the stack's LIFO nature.
