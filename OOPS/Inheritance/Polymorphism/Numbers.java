/*
Java looks for a method that matches exactly the types you passed in.

You passed two ints â†’ sum(int, int) perfectly matches method #3.
âœ… So Java directly picks that one.
It wonâ€™t even consider sum(double, int) because int, int already has an exact match.

ðŸ§® But if you didnâ€™t have sum(int, int) defined,

then the compiler would look for the closest match.

Here, it sees:

sum(double, int) is possible because Java can implicitly widen your first int to a double.
So your sum(2, 4) would become sum(2.0, 4) behind the scenes.
