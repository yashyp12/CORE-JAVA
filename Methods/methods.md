# You can call a method inside another method (like main), not directly in the class body.


Always call methods from inside another method, constructor, or blockâ€”not directly in the class body.
 
 The static keyword means belonging to the class, not to any object.
Static members (methods or variables) are shared by all objects of the class.

Static methods: Can only access static variables/methods directly (not instance variables).
