SWITCH - 

whenever we use switch expression it should return something as an output

swithc expression - kuch bhi kar pr value return hona chahiye


yield- when thode statements ke baad 
we need to write value after yield 0;

when do we use yield /
-> when i want to give an value but after some statements

-> block is needed used when we want to return some statement before execution
before returning the val if i wnt to return something
