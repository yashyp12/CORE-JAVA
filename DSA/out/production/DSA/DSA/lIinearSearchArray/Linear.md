Time complexity - 
BEST CASE - O(1)  //CONSTANT
worst case = O(N) //N -> SIZE OF ARRAY


BEST CASE - THE Element we are searching for are found in first case 

worst  case - we do not find the item 

TIME COMPLEXITU Y -  as the size of the input is growing how my time is growing 

constants -  O(1) taking constant amount of time like if elemetn are found everytime on 1 st index  of the array
