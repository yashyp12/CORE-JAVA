//     Accessing Elements of Three-Dimensional Arrays
// Elements in three-dimensional arrays are commonly referred by x[i][j][k] where 'i' is the array number, 'j' is the row number and 'k' is the column number. 

// Note: In arrays if size of array is N. Its index will be from 0 to N-1. Therefore, for row_index 2, actual row number is 2+1 = 3.
