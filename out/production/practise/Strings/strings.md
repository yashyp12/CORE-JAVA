# Strings - collection of sequence of characters

- strings are immutable in java
- strings objects are stored inside the heap - string pool 

### **STRING POOL -** 
- String pool is a part of heap memory , its a seperate memory structure inside the heap 
- similar types of values are not recreated inside the string pool
- makes code optimis
- we cannot change the object in the string pool ,because strings are immutable for the security reasons
