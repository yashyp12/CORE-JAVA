**What are annotations?**
Annotations are metadata tags you add to your code to give additional information to the compiler or to other tools and frameworks. They do not change how the program runs on their own, but they provide a standard way to embed configuration and other details directly into the source code.

**What are they used for?**
Compile-time checks: Built-in annotations like @Override instruct the compiler to perform checks and catch potential errors.
Code generation: Tools can read annotations to automatically generate boilerplate code, such as getters and setters, which reduces the amount of manual code you need to write.
* Runtime processing: Frameworks like Spring and Hibernate use annotations to configure and manage application behavior dynamically at runtime, replacing verbose XML files with a more direct, in-code approach.
